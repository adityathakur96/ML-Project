# ML-Project


The datasets that i have taken are from  https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/100k/  this site .

In this mini ml Project I have used ALS (Alternating Least Squares) algorithm on apache spark with python to give you the movie recommendations.
Carrying over thousands of data points spark gives you the edge in computation time. 

We can also use another datasets available on the given website, but for that you have know the concept of clustering and want cloud platform to support you,
so that we can get more nodes to work upon
